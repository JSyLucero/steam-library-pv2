#### Method 2 - Steam Launch Arguments
**Installation Instructions**

    The installation instructions are similar to method #1, although a bit different.

    The first step for this, you will be required to exit Steam first.

    Go to the directory where your Steam install is located and go into:
    "<Steam Install Path>\steamui\"
    By default Steam is located at "C:\Program files (86)\Steam\" or "C:\Program files (86)\Steam\"
    
    Copy or drag the following files and folder - the "css" folder, libraryroot.custom.css, 
    libraryroot.original.css and config.css into the "steamui" located in Steam.
    
    Once everything is placed, you will need to exit Steam.
    From here you will be required to add launch arguments to Steam.
    
    The required Steam launch arguments to use for this are... 
    "-noverifyfiles" and "-norepairfiles", after these arguments are placed launch Steam!

    Enjoy~
