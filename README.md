# Steam Library - PixelVision2
This Steam Library Skin is made by Xishiora (aka JSyLucero on GitHub) in order to make the new Steam Library match the UI of PixelVision2.  

**PixelVision2 Library Download:** https://github.com/JSyLucero/steam-library-pv2/archive/master.zip

## Installation
### Windows
### Method 1 - SteamFriendsPatcher
#### Requirements

**SteamFriendsPatcher by PhantomGamers:** https://github.com/PhantomGamers/SteamFriendsPatcher/releases/latest  

#### Installation Instructions

    Go to the directory where your Steam install is located and go into:
    "<Steam Install Path>\steamui\"
    By default Steam is located at "C:\Program files (86)\Steam\" or "C:\Program files (86)\Steam\"
    
    Copy or drag libraryroot.custom.css and config.css into the "steamui" located in Steam.
    
    Once everything is placed, run the SteamFriendsPatcher by PhantomGamers and you're good to go.
    Note: If the patcher doesn't end up working, click [Force Check] in the patcher.

### Method 2 - Steam Launch Arguments
**Note:** I highly recommend **Method 1** as this method will keep Steam from updating I believe.
However, you may proceed with this method if you wish.

#### Installation Instructions

    The installation instructions are similar to method #1, although a bit different.

    Go to the directory where your Steam install is located and go into:
    "<Steam Install Path>\steamui\"
    By default Steam is located at "C:\Program files (86)\Steam\" or "C:\Program files (86)\Steam\"
    
    Once inside the Steam\steamui folder, you will want to enter the steamui\css folder 
    and then cut the libraryroot.css file and paste it into the Steam\steamui folder
    then rename it to "libraryroot.original.css"

    After the above steps you will want to copy or drag the following files and folder -
    the "css" folder, libraryroot.custom.css, and config.css into the Steam\steamui folder.
    
    From here you will be required to add launch arguments to Steam.
    
    The required Steam launch arguments to use for this are... -noverifyfiles and -norepairfiles
    After these arguments are placed Steam should launch without removing the skin~

    Enjoy!~
